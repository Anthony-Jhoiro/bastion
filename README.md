This repo is used to create your custom bastion. It handles :
- Connecting to a network (Only with NetworkManager for now)
- Auto discovery on network (Only with Nmap for now)
- Cashing and revalidating auto discovery results for faster connection

All of that powered by [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
